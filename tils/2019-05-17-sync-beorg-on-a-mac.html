        <p>Iâ€™ve recently moved from vim to emacs (specifically spacemacs) as my full time editor. Org-mode was a large motivation for that switch. Being able to access some org-mode documents with my phone can be very helpfuly as well. I have been using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beorg-to-do-list-agenda/id1238649962?mt=8">beorg</a> recently. Beorg gives you the option of syncing with a few services. I use iCloud heavily, so I opted for that.</p>
<p>This is easy to use on your mac if you find the location that beorg syncs, which happens to be <code>~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~appsonthemove~beorg/Documents/org</code>.</p>
<p>Here, beorg has a default <code>inbox.org</code> for managing TODOs, but will keep any structure of org mode files as well.</p>
